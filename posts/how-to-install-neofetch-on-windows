Getting Neofetch installed on Windows is easier than you might think. You simply need a PowerShell terminal and follow these steps:
[list=1] 
[*]Enter this command into the PowerShell terminal that’ll give permission to run the next steps: 
[code]Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser[/code]
[*]Run this command next to install Scoop:
[code]iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex[/code]
[*]Now that scoop is installed, it’s time to install neofetch:
[code]scoop install neofetch[/code]
[*]The last step to install neofetch is to install git:
[code]scoop install git[/code]
[/list] 
What’s awesome about Linux, is that with neofetch installed, combined with a quick bashsrc edit neofetch can start automatically with the terminal. Let’s make that possible with Windows by making a regedit change:
[list=1] 
[*]You’ll want to run regedit by [b]Win+R[/b] and typing [b]regedit[/b].
[*]Navigate to:
[code]HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor[/code]
[*]Right click and select [b]New > String Value[/b] with the name as [b]AutoRun[/b] with a value of [b]neofetch[/b]
[*]Once saved, just open command prompt as usual to see neofetch automatically run!
[/list] 
Unfortunately, neofetch won’t run in programs like Tabby automatically. A more robust solution is to create a CMD file that has all the things you’d like to autorun on a new command prompt session:
[list=1] 
[*]Create a new file under home directory named [b]autorun.cmd[/b]
[*]Fill [b]autorun.cmd[/b] with:
[code]
@echo off && C:\Users\%username%\scoop\apps\git\current\bin\bash.exe C:\Users\%username%\scoop\apps\neofetch\current\neofetch
[/code]
Save the file and go back and change the [b]AutoRun[/b] value to [b]C:\Users\yourusername\autorun.cmd[/b].
[/list] 

That’s it! It’ll now function in CMD as well as programs like Tabby.
